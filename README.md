- [**9-react-custom-hooks**](https://github.com/john-mcgurk/React---The-Complete-Guide/tree/master/9-react-custom-hooks): Mini to-do list project which uses my own custom hook - useHttp, which allows for app-wide logic on HTTP requests whilst also executing variable HTTP requests, and transforming returned data.
- [**10-working-with-forms**](https://github.com/john-mcgurk/React---The-Complete-Guide/tree/master/9-react-custom-hooks): Basic sign-up form using React hooks for custom styling and validation.
- [**11-food-order-webapp-v2**](https://github.com/john-mcgurk/React---The-Complete-Guide/tree/master/11-food-order-webapp-v2): Building on the previous webapp from section 5, I introduce; an API to dynamically load the meals, a cart section that sends post requests on submission of order, user feedback modals during submission,  updated context functions to clear cart after checkout.
- [**12-exploring-redux**](https://github.com/john-mcgurk/React---The-Complete-Guide/tree/master/12-exploring-redux): This project introduces a new context provider - redux. Using redux I build a basic counter that stores and dispatches actions using redux to update the counter. I then use redux-tookit to implement multi-state management in context - one slice dedicated to the counter application, and another dedicated to a basic authentication application.
- [**13-advanced-redux**](https://github.com/john-mcgurk/React---The-Complete-Guide/tree/master/13-advanced-redux): I implement a simple bookstore app that uses redux with side-effects and async code to add, remove and fetch books cart data from an outside RTDB hosted on firebase. I also used Redux devtools to trace and monitor state changes in the app.
- [**14-mpa-with-react-router**](https://github.com/john-mcgurk/React---The-Complete-Guide/tree/master/14-mpa-with-react-router): Building on react router hooks and practices, I build a 'multi-page' SPA using a variety of new tools. The app is connected to firebase to allow for storing, adding and fetching of quotes. Also allowing the user to make comments on given quotes - also stored on firebase. Dynamic query params, useHistory hook and routing logic all explored. Current version uses React Router v5, although later lectures detail how to migrate to v6 and the new features added in the React Router update.
- [**14.5-mpa-with-react-router-v6**](https://github.com/john-mcgurk/React---The-Complete-Guide/tree/master/14.5-mpa-with-react-router-v6): An multi-page event management website that makes extensive use of the new hooks available in react router v6. To run the project, first npm install and start within the api-backend folder, then in a new terminal npm install and start within the react-frontend folder.
- [**15-authentication-in-react**](https://github.com/john-mcgurk/React---The-Complete-Guide/tree/master/15-authentication-in-react): Extension of the events management website developed in section 14.5. Added authentication using backend api to return a token and conditionally render components based on existence of token within the registered expiration time. Auto logout after 1 hour and routes protected using loaders in the browser router defined on App.js
